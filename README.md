# Spacex_Capstone_Project
This capstone project focuses on predicting the landing outcome of SpaceX Falcon 9 boosters using machine learning. SpaceX aims to make space exploration more cost-effective by reusing rocket boosters, and accurately predicting whether a booster will successfully land is critical for mission planning and cost optimization.
